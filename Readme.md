## Abstract

This document outlines a technical standard for a wireless docking station designed to eliminate the daily inconvenience of connecting cables to laptops and other devices. The concept is based on a seamless "drop-and-connect" experience, where a user simply places their device onto a stand to instantly connect to power, peripherals, and displays.

## The Problem

Current docking solutions, even those leveraging modern standards like Thunderbolt or USB-C, fail to offer true convenience. They still require the physical action of plugging in a cable, which is often cumbersome. The market lacks a universal, truly cable-free standard that allows a user to simply arrive, place their device down, and be fully connected.

## The Proposed Solution

The core of this solution is a short-range, high-speed optical data link, combined with wireless power transfer. While initial thoughts considered radio-based systems, light was chosen for its superior speed potential. Technologies like Li-Fi exist but are not typically applied for millimeter-range communication between a device and a dock.

The key to making this a universal standard is the **standardized position of the optical transceiver**:
* **Location:** On the underside of the device (laptop, smartphone, etc.).
* **Placement:** Centrally located, at a fixed distance of **30 mm from the bottom edge**.

This standardized placement ensures that a single dock design can be compatible with a wide range of device sizes, from large laptops to smaller smartphones.

### General Architecture

The system consists of two main components:
1.  **Optical Data Link:** An optical transceiver on both the device and the docking station for data transfer.
2.  **Wireless Power Link:** An inductive charging coil on both the device and the dock for power.

### Power Component

* **Technology:** Wireless charging based on existing or future standards (e.g., Qi, Qi2).
* **Requirements:** The standard must support a wide power delivery range, from **15W** for smaller devices to **over 100W** for performance laptops. It must be designed to avoid electronic interference with other components. The current Qi standard is already sufficient for most office laptops.

### Data Component & Alignment Mechanism

The data component is designed for robust, high-speed communication and effortless alignment.

* **Optical Sensor:** The transceiver will be as small and thin as possible (e.g., **8mm x 8mm**). It is surrounded by a magnetic rubber gasket, which serves two purposes:
    1.  **Light Isolation:** It creates a light-proof seal to enable low-power LEDs and prevent ambient light interference.
    2.  **Physical Docking:** It provides a soft, secure physical connection.

* **Standardized Position:** As stated, the sensor is located on the underside of the device, **centered, 30 mm from the bottom edge**.

* **Alignment & Status Indicators:** The docking process is guided by a user-friendly 3-LED system on the stand:
    * Three small indicator lights mark the sensor's location on the stand.
    * **Off-Center:** One yellow light illuminates on the right or left side, indicating the direction needed to center the device.
    * **Centering:** As the device moves closer to the center, the lights turn white sequentially.
    * **Connected:** All three lights turn solid **green** when the device is perfectly aligned and the data link is established.
    * **Error:** All three lights turn solid **red** if there is a connection problem.

* **Magnetic Assist:** The alignment process is aided by two small magnets on the stand, positioned on either side of the sensor. As the device gets close, they attract the device's metallic chassis or a corresponding plate, and also cause the dock's gasket to raise by a few millimeters (max **3 mm** excursion) to gently grip the device, ensuring a perfect connection. Once connected, the experience is identical to plugging in a single cable.

### Sensor Placement

As defined by the standard, the sensor is centrally located on the underside of the device.

### Implementation Details

* **Handshake:** Once physically aligned, the software handshake is functionally similar to connecting a standard USB-C cable, transparently managing all data protocols.
* **Data Transfer:** All data (video, USB, Ethernet, etc.) is digitized and transmitted over the single high-speed optical link.
* **Potential Speed:** Over **200 Gbit/s**.

### Advantages

* **Simplicity:** The only cable required is the one powering the docking station itself.
* **Full Functionality:** Provides access to all standard peripherals: Ethernet, USB ports, multiple monitors, etc.
* **Seamless Experience:** The device is held stable by magnets (strong enough for a secure connection but weak enough for easy removal).
* **Automation:** The system can be configured to automatically power on the laptop as soon as a successful connection is established.
